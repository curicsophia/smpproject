Stance on question:
The meritocracy system, in it's quest to be fair, has given the more affiliated families a bigger boost to get the children to prosper. By giving more resources to students so that the lower income still receives quality education, the higher income students now can devote more money to further their studies, and thusThe meritocracy system, in it's quest to be fair, has given the more affiliated families a bigger boost to get the children to prosper. By giving more resources to students so that the lower income still receives quality education, the higher income students now can devote more money to further their studies, and thus it's not fair for the lower income students. I feel that SG is trying to make sure that the majority excel, by sacrificing the same opportunity for lower income students. Meritocracy forcing students to place high importance on studies, specifically for lower income students who, without access to external education like tuition, need to study a lot more.Some of my peers, like Keller, have a lot of time and resources to pursue more projects, specifically in the engineering sector. So I would say the meritocracy system did not benefit me. it's not fair for the lower income students.

stance on question:
i definitely think the government has put in quite a fair bit of effort in striving towards meritocracy, but it's definitely not working really well right now singaporean meritocracy has benefited me, because my parents were really lucky to have been beneficiaries of meritocracy, and i'm really lucky to be in this school and all, but at the same time as long as capitalism remains the dominant economic system in our current world order, trying to achieve pure meritocracy is close to impossible due to contradictions - those who benefit from meritocracy and enjoy a higher social standing seek to pass it on to their children (which is understandable) but with this higher social standing they can afford "safeguards" in a sense like tuition, or being in a position to allow their children to read from a young age etc, because these benefits are disproportionately granted to the wealthy under a capitalist, meritocratic system, and will eventually lead to the poor stuck in a poverty cycle when they don't have a fair shot at a supposedly meritocratic system

"So um, firstly, um, how prevalent do you think corporal punishment is at this moment?", generally passionate and determined to defend personal views and opinions, may be passive-aggressive about it
